# orange_layout
Simple one page for practising skills and to work with poi.js and ejs templates 
| Design made by @theawwwesomes and it was indluding only desktop so I extended it for mobile and tablets to make responsive website.


This project was created with HTML webpack plugin.
To change content on a page, you can just go to the file: content.js and change a proper line.

## Available Scripts

To run the project first you have to install dependencies

### `npm install`

then it's possible to: 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>


### `npm build`
Because of unknown problems with an installation cross-env dependency, before run npm build, first in poi.config.js you must uncomment this line: config.output.publicPath = './' 

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It bundles project in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
